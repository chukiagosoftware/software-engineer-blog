Officially a Computer and Electrical Engineer, B.Sc. (nice!). I&rsquo;ve mostly been a Network and Security, then Devops,
Site Reliability and more recently an AI, AWS/GCP and Go engineer. This is my blog, not really a portfolio and not too serious.
Just some notes and musings on my journey as a software engineer. :sun:
My passion is building fun applications, staying at the cutting edge of Cloud, Kubernetes,
OpenTelemetry and AI of course. 
:server:
I&rsquo;ve built and helped to scale and observe a variety of SaaS, Webex Videoconferencing, Jitsi videoconference,
SIP/WebRTC VoIP and IP Telephony Contact Center, Big Data parallel processing, Machine Learning neural network models,
Large Language Generative Pretrained Transformer Models, Confluent Kafka event streaming, Postgre/MySQL/Redshift/Auror database
modelling, data ingestion, processing, LLM model fine-tuning.
Recently I&rsquo;ve worked on vectorizing data with Go for RAG, modelling input data with AWS Glue, Athena and Redshift
implementing performant AI-based systems in AWS Kubernetes with
OpenTelemetry, Prometheus and/or Datadog for real time metrics and analytics.
My most recent CI/CD and programming language are Github Actions and Go. I&rsquo;ve also worked heavily with Jenkins (I know), ArgoCD, Google Cloudbuild,
Python, Javascript, Ansible but, I&rsquo;m not going to talk about those.
My speciality du jour is building, deploying apps written in Go and Python and handling AWS, Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry or Prometheus metrics
for an end to end system such as for Generative AI (Large Language Models) applications.
I&rsquo;m somewhat of a nerd and I am  really good with Terraform. Like stupid good.
While I am solely responsible for all this crap- I mean, content- I do have to thank Grok and Claude for helping make the
conversion fast and mostly painless. Also, thanks to my friends and family for supporting me and my wife."><meta name=author content="Eric Arellano"><link rel=canonical href=https://ericarellano.tech/about/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://ericarellano.tech/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://ericarellano.tech/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://ericarellano.tech/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://ericarellano.tech/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://ericarellano.tech/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://ericarellano.tech/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://ericarellano.tech/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Another Software Engineering Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Intro"><meta property="og:description" content="About Me Officially a Computer and Electrical Engineer, B.Sc.

These are just the publicly available emojis which you can see around the pages. I find that there are some really, really cool ones and thus without further ado.\nActually, this is no longer true. This is now a Go Hugo site.\nHugo is really cool, has Go templating engine, emojis and others are a breeze to add using shortcodes and will allow me to delve more into the Go ecosystem as I develop my Hotel Recommendations Rag application.\nThe Platform The blog code is deployed based on Git ops.\nIn other words, the Python code which generates html, is pushed to a main branch integrated with Ci/Cd service Netlify\nI use Jetbrains Pycharm, so this is done either by typing git push in the Terminal or Cmd-K in the IDE window. I highly recommend it.\nOther options I considered for deployment over the years were Google App Engine, Render and a VM on Digital Ocean or a free Oracle VM.\nAfter running off a Google Bucket with local-only Pelican html generation, I settled on Netlify a few years back because it works very nicely, can scale to a fullblown app with CDN and content managment and more importantly Netlify had Python 3.10 compatible images at the time.\nThis is a static HTML with some Javascript and a Pelican template. So, there is only one contributor, no merging, PRs and other differences with a production distributed microservice or hybrid service architecture. Netlify has a nice build image for Python and static sites.\nAgain, the above is no longer true. This is now a Hugo static microblog which is published via Github Actions to Github Pages.\nThe conversion from Python (Pelican) to Go (Hugo) was done with the help of Grok to provide some handy Python scripts. Github Pages is now very mature and Github Actions allows me to build the suite upon pushes to Main, then deploy off a special branch all without leaving Github.\nThe Future I suppose I plan to add more content, enable searching and make the text and appearance more professional looking.\nAlso, once completed we will have a widget with my Hotel Recommendation assistant.\nI also plan to migrate to Hugo or another static site generator.\nAs noted a bunch of times (sorry) this migration is now done.
