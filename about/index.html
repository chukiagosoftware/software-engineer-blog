Hey! A while ago I received my degree as a Computer and Electrical Engineer, B.Sc. (2005, U. Texas at Austin).
Throughout my career I&rsquo;ve learned many aspects of modern Software Engineering, including AI, Software Development, Network Security, Enterprise Autonomics, SaaS,
and Contact Centers. Wherein I&rsquo;ve coded, deployed, and operated services written in Go, Python, JavaScript, Java, as well as Bash shell script.
I&rsquo;ve held roles across small, medium-sized, and large companies.
In the last 7 years my work focused on AI and Machine Learning operations and product development leveraging Devops, Site Reliability, and Clouds.
Startups 
Regarding startups, I&rsquo;m very knowledgeable in helping to scale new products and services using AWS/GCP/Azure, Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD, Jenkins,
and implementing proper telemetry for metrics, traces, and logs.
I can help to certify software and platform for SOC2 and FedRAMP and maintain security best practices
for cloud infrastructure and data.

Although, this is just a personal blog mostly containing random notes and musings on my journey as a software engineer.

My passion is building fun applications, and currently staying at the cutting edge of Go, Cloud, Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry, and Machine Learning.
Experience 
I&rsquo;ve built and helped to scale and observe a variety of services providing from Web SaaS, Webex Video, Jitsi video, IP Telephony Contact Center,
Big Data processing, Machine Learning with NN and LLM Gen AI models.
As part of this I helped to deploy, integrate, and operate Confluent Kafka, Postgres on RDS, AWS SQS, Redis on Elastic Cache,
ActiveMQ/RabbitMQ, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server in addition to cloud data engineering tools such as AWS Athena and Redshift
or Google BigQuery and Cloud SQL.
Clouds 
I am equally useful with AWS running EKS and Sagemaker and GCP running GKE and Vertex AI.  For example, I&rsquo;ve deployed both
extensively with Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, Python, and workflow/automation tools such as ArgoCD and Stackstorm.
In the realm of Kubernetes I have expert-level experience with Helm, Kustomize, controllers, Prometheus, Grafana, Load Balancing
Controllers such as AWS LB, Nginx, and application gateway layers from AWS, Google and Istio.
Projects 
Recently I helped to code and deploy a Go service with API endpoints for gathering document inputs as HTML, PDF, and SQL data
and processing them with Go for Weaviate and Google AI Search. This allowed the data to be stored as embeddings in vector tables
and correspondingly allowed vector similarity searches to build a set of documents as input for a final LLM completion.
Further I&rsquo;ve helped to deploy this service on Kubernetes as part of a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system
on top of OpenAI GPT 3/4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and other LLM and NN models for prompt completion as well as
question classification, security guardrails and custom policy enforcement.
Other Skills 
As of November 2024, I hold a DeepLearning.AI Professional Data Engineer certification covering Python, Jupyter and production
data analysis, design, schema transformation and other aspects of ETL and ELT.
In the past, I&rsquo;ve held multiple Cisco CCNA networking certs in the 2000&rsquo;s and 2010&rsquo;s, SIP Voice over IP SSCA and SSCVVP in 2016.
I always \enjoy keeping up with new programming languages and frameworks, the latest being Go and some dabbling in Rust.
Yes, I&rsquo;m most definitely a nerd !!
As far as building AWS or GCP cloud infra for ML/Kubernetes/compute, I am real good using Terraform and Pulumi or Ansible."><meta name=author content="Eric Arellano"><link rel=canonical href=https://ericarellano.tech/about/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://ericarellano.tech/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://ericarellano.tech/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://ericarellano.tech/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://ericarellano.tech/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://ericarellano.tech/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://ericarellano.tech/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://ericarellano.tech/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Eric's Software Engineering Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Intro"><meta property="og:description" content="About Me Hey!

These are just the publicly available emojis which you can see around the pages. I find that there are some really, really cool ones and thus without further ado.\nActually, the above is no longer true. This is now a Go Hugo site. A moment of silence for Python and Pelican, which served me well for years, and my custom Markdown extension for Github Emojis which is superceded by Hugo’s built-in support for shortcodes.\nThis microblog Hugo is really cool, has a built-in Go templating engine, allows emojis and other HTML features easily using shortcodes. I’m looking forward to adding on to the site with Go’s ecosystem as I develop my Hotel Recommendations RAG/LLM application.\nI resisted updating this blog- and learning more Go-for several years mainly because I loved Python and the Pelican microblogging framework worked out. But I’ve since found that Go is my new favorite language and am thrilled with the power and simplicity of the standard library and tools. Python Async and FastAPI can’t really hold a candle to Go routines and net/http (sorry!).\nThe Platform The blog HTML and JavaScript/CSS code is deployed based on simple Git ops with Github Actions. The HTML is stored in a separate branch, and each push to the main branch triggers a build and deployment to Github Pages. DNS is handled by another provider with CNAM records, nothing fancy.\nIn other words, the Python code which generates html, is pushed to a main branch integrated with Ci/Cd service Netlify\nI use Jetbrains Pycharm, so this is done either by typing git push in the Terminal or Cmd-K in the IDE window. I highly recommend it.\nAlternatives Other options I had tested for deployment over the years were Google App Engine, Render and a VM on Digital Ocean or a free Oracle VM.\nAfter running off a Google Bucket with local-only Pelican html generation, I settled on Netlify a few years back because it worked very nicely, can scale to a full-blown app with CDN and content management, and more importantly Netlify had Python 3.10 compatible images at the time.\nThis is a static HTML with some Javascript and a Pelican template. So, there is only one contributor, no merging, PRs, and other differences with a production distributed microservice or hybrid service architecture. Netlify has a nice build image for Python and static sites.\nThe above is no longer true (again). This is now a Hugo static microblog, which is published via Github Actions to Github Pages.\nThe conversion from Python (Pelican) to Go (Hugo) was done with the help of Grok to provide some handy Python scripts. Github Pages is now very mature, and Github Actions allows me to build the suite upon pushes to Main, then deploy off a special branch all without leaving Github.\nThe Future Someday, this blog may undergo its next conversion using Rust, unless another cooler language or Go framework comes along first.\nAlso, once my work on Alpaca is complete, we will have a widget with my Hotel Recommendation assistant and mabye even some nice tables with Hotel Review data analysis.\nThanks for reading!

Controllers such as AWS LB, Nginx, and application gateway layers from AWS, Google and Istio.</p><h4 id=projects-hahahugoshortcode4s6hbhb>Projects <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f477-2642.png?v8 alt=:construction_worker_man: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#projects-hahahugoshortcode4s6hbhb>#</a></h4><p>Recently I helped to code and deploy a Go service with API endpoints for gathering document inputs as HTML, PDF, and SQL data
and processing them with Go for Weaviate and Google AI Search. This allowed the data to be stored as embeddings in vector tables
and correspondingly allowed vector similarity searches to build a set of documents as input for a final LLM completion.</p><p>Further I&rsquo;ve helped to deploy this service on Kubernetes as part of a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system<br>on top of OpenAI GPT 3/4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, and other LLM and NN models for prompt completion as well as
question classification, security guardrails and custom policy enforcement.</p><h4 id=other-skills-hahahugoshortcode4s7hbhb>Other Skills <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f9e0.png?v8 alt=:brain: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#other-skills-hahahugoshortcode4s7hbhb>#</a></h4><p>As of November 2024, I hold a DeepLearning.AI Professional Data Engineer certification covering Python, Jupyter and production
data analysis, design, schema transformation and other aspects of ETL and ELT.</p><p>In the past, I&rsquo;ve held multiple Cisco CCNA networking certs in the 2000&rsquo;s and 2010&rsquo;s, SIP Voice over IP SSCA and SSCVVP in 2016.</p><p>I always \enjoy keeping up with new programming languages and frameworks, the latest being Go and some dabbling in Rust.</p><p>Yes, I&rsquo;m most definitely a nerd <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f913.png?v8 alt=:nerd_face: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle>!!</p><p>As far as building AWS or GCP cloud infra for ML/Kubernetes/compute, I am real good using Terraform and Pulumi or Ansible.</p><h4 id=the-icons-hahahugoshortcode4s9hbhb>The Icons <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/shipit.png?v8 alt=:shipit: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-icons-hahahugoshortcode4s9hbhb>#</a></h4><p><del>The site runs on Python 3.10 with the Pelican 4.8.0 microblog software and my custom Python Markdown 3.4.1 extension
for the Github Emojis. These are just the publicly available emojis which you can see around the pages. I find that
there are some really, really cool ones and thus without further ado.</del></p><p>Actually, the above is no longer true. This is now a Go Hugo site. A moment of silence for Python <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f40d.png?v8 alt=:snake: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle>
and Pelican, which served me well for years, and my custom Markdown extension for Github Emojis which is superceded by Hugo&rsquo;s
built-in support for shortcodes.</p><h3 id=this-microblog-hahahugoshortcode4s11hbhb>This microblog <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f3ca.png?v8 alt=:swimmer: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#this-microblog-hahahugoshortcode4s11hbhb>#</a></h3><p>Hugo is really cool, has a built-in Go templating engine, allows emojis and other HTML features easily using shortcodes. I&rsquo;m looking forward to
adding on to the site with Go&rsquo;s ecosystem as I develop my Hotel Recommendations RAG/LLM application.</p><p>I resisted updating this blog- and learning more Go-for several years mainly because I loved Python and the Pelican microblogging
framework worked out. But I&rsquo;ve since found that Go is my new favorite language and am thrilled with the power and simplicity of
the standard library and tools. Python Async and FastAPI can&rsquo;t really hold a candle to Go routines and net/http (sorry!).</p><h4 id=the-platform-hahahugoshortcode4s12hbhb>The Platform <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/godmode.png?v8 alt=:godmode: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-platform-hahahugoshortcode4s12hbhb>#</a></h4><p>The blog HTML and JavaScript/CSS code is deployed based on simple Git ops with Github Actions. The HTML is stored in a separate
branch, and each push to the main branch triggers a build and deployment to Github Pages. DNS is handled by another provider with
CNAM records, nothing fancy.</p><p><del>In other words, the Python code which generates html, is pushed to a main branch
integrated with Ci/Cd service <a href=https://www.netlify.com>Netlify</a></del></p><p><del>I use Jetbrains Pycharm, so this is done either by typing <em>git push</em> in the Terminal or Cmd-K in the IDE window. I
highly recommend it.</del></p><h4 id=alternatives-hahahugoshortcode4s13hbhb>Alternatives <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f914.png?v8 alt=:thinking: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alternatives-hahahugoshortcode4s13hbhb>#</a></h4><p>Other options I had tested for deployment over the years were Google App Engine, <a href=https://www.render.com>Render</a> and a VM on Digital
Ocean or a <a href=https://docs.oracle.com/es-ww/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm>free Oracle VM</a>.</p><p>After running off a Google Bucket with local-only Pelican html generation, I settled on Netlify a few years back because
it worked very nicely, can scale to a full-blown app with CDN and content management, and
more importantly <a href=https://ericarellano.tech/posts/netlify/>Netlify had Python 3.10</a> compatible images at the time.</p><p><del>This is a static HTML with some Javascript and a Pelican template. So, there is only one contributor, no
merging, PRs, and other differences with a production distributed microservice or hybrid service
architecture. Netlify has a nice build image for Python and static sites.</del></p><p>The above is no longer true (again). This is now a Hugo static microblog, which is published via Github Actions to Github Pages.</p><p>The conversion from Python (Pelican) to Go (Hugo) was done with the help of Grok to provide some handy Python scripts. Github Pages
is now very mature, and Github Actions allows me to build the suite upon pushes to Main, then deploy off a special branch all without leaving Github.</p><h4 id=the-future-hahahugoshortcode4s15hbhb>The Future <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f52e.png?v8 alt=:crystal_ball: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-future-hahahugoshortcode4s15hbhb>#</a></h4><p>Someday, this blog may undergo its next conversion using Rust, unless another cooler language or Go framework comes along first.</p><p>Also, once my work on <a href=https://github.com/chukiagosoftware/alpaca>Alpaca</a> is complete, we will have a widget with my Hotel Recommendation assistant and mabye even
some nice tables with Hotel Review data analysis.</p><h5 id=thanks-for-reading-hahahugoshortcode4s16hbhb>Thanks for reading! <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4b5.png?v8 alt=:dollar: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#thanks-for-reading-hahahugoshortcode4s16hbhb>#</a></h5><h4 id=some-links-hahahugoshortcode4s17hbhb>Some Links <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f517.png?v8 alt=:link: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#some-links-hahahugoshortcode4s17hbhb>#</a></h4><p>Here are some useful links:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/CL02KD2ZFW8A>My Data Engineering Professional Cert</a></li><li><a href=https://www.credly.com/badges/91dbaf61-46b0-4d9c-9703-0ed47259000a/public_url>My Cisco Gen AI Blue Belt</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/edamsoft-sre>My Github</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-arellano-martinez>My LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://x.com/>News</a></li><li><a href=https://www.k8s.io>Kubernetes</a></li><li><a href=https://goloang.org>Go</a></li><li><a href=https://registry.terraform.io>Terraform</a></li><li><a href=https://www.python.org>Python</a></li></ul><hr></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=https://ericarellano.tech/>Eric's Software Engineering Blog</a></span> ·
