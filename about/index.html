Hey! A while ago I received my degree as a Computer and Electrical Engineer, B.Sc. (2005, U. Texas at Austin).
Throughout my career I&rsquo;ve learned many aspects of modern Software Engineering, including Development, Network Security, Enterprise Autonomics, Web SaaS,
Contact Centers, Go, Python, Javascript, Java, and Bash shell scripting. I&rsquo;ve held roles across small, medium-sized, and large companies.
In the last 7 years my work has focused on AI and Machine Learning operations and product development, Devops, Site Reliability, and Clouds.
Startups 
I am very knowledgeable in helping to scale new products and services using AWS/GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ci/Cd, and
proper telemetry or observability. I can also help to certify for SOC2, FedRAMP and generally maintain security best practices
for cloud infrastructure, data, and applications.
This is my personal blog, not really a portfolio and not too serious. Just some notes and musings on my journey as a software engineer. 
My passion is building fun applications, staying at the cutting edge of Go, Cloud, Kubernetes,
OpenTelemetry, and AI of course. 
Experience 
I&rsquo;ve built and helped to scale and observe a variety of services providing from Web SaaS, Webex Video, Jitsi video, IP Telephony Contact Center,
Big Data processing, Machine Learning with NN and LLM Gen AI models.Confluent Kafka event streaming, Postgres/MySQL/Redshift/Aurora database
I am experienced at building, integrating, and scaling Confluent Kafka, Postgres/RDS, AWS SQS, Redis and several other
message queues, databases en data engineering tools such as AWS Athena and Redshift or Google BigQuery.
Clouds 
I am about equally useful with AWS, EKS, Sagemaker and GCP, GKE, Vertex AI, for example.
Projects 
Recently I&rsquo;ve worked on gathering inputs from HTML, PDF, and SQL data with Go and generating vectorized embeddings to implement
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on top of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Open Source models.
Other Skills 
I hold a DeepLearning.AI Professional Data Engineer certification from 2024, multiple Cisco networking certs in the 2000&rsquo;s and 2010&rsquo;s,
and enjoy keeping up with new programming languages and frameworks, the latest being Go.
Definitely a nerd , I am real good using Terraform from zero up to deploying pipelines with
Github Actions, or Terraform Cloud.
I&rsquo;ve also worked extensively in building telemetry with Go and Python and ML teams with end-to-end observability and
distributed tracing into Datadog or Tempo using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, or Datadog native metrics."><meta name=author content="Eric Arellano"><link rel=canonical href=https://ericarellano.tech/about/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://ericarellano.tech/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://ericarellano.tech/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://ericarellano.tech/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://ericarellano.tech/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://ericarellano.tech/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://ericarellano.tech/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://ericarellano.tech/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Eric's Software Engineering Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Intro"><meta property="og:description" content="About Me Hey!

These are just the publicly available emojis which you can see around the pages. I find that there are some really, really cool ones and thus without further ado.\nActually, this is no longer true. This is now a Go Hugo site. A moment of silence for Python and Pelican, which served me well for years.\nThis microblog Hugo is really cool, has a built-in Go templating engine, allows emojis and other HTML features easily using shortcodes. I’m looking forward to adding on to the site with Go’s ecosystem as I develop my Hotel Recommendations RAG/LLM application.\nI resisted updating this blog- and learning more Go-for several years mainly because I loved Python and the Pelican microblogging framework worked out. But I’ve since found that Go is my new favorite language and am thrilled with the power and simplicity of the standard library and tools. Python Async and FastAPI can’t really hold a candle to Go routines and net/http (sorry!).\nThe Platform The blog HTML and Javascript/CSS code is deployed based on simple Git ops with Github Actions.\nIn other words, the Python code which generates html, is pushed to a main branch integrated with Ci/Cd service Netlify\nI use Jetbrains Pycharm, so this is done either by typing git push in the Terminal or Cmd-K in the IDE window. I highly recommend it.\nAlternatives Other options I considered for deployment over the years were Google App Engine, Render and a VM on Digital Ocean or a free Oracle VM.\nAfter running off a Google Bucket with local-only Pelican html generation, I settled on Netlify a few years back because it works very nicely, can scale to a full-blown app with CDN and content management, and more importantly Netlify had Python 3.10 compatible images at the time.\nThis is a static HTML with some Javascript and a Pelican template. So, there is only one contributor, no merging, PRs, and other differences with a production distributed microservice or hybrid service architecture. Netlify has a nice build image for Python and static sites.\nThe above is no longer true (again). This is now a Hugo static microblog, which is published via Github Actions to Github Pages.\nThe conversion from Python (Pelican) to Go (Hugo) was done with the help of Grok to provide some handy Python scripts. Github Pages is now very mature and Github Actions allows me to build the suite upon pushes to Main, then deploy off a special branch all without leaving Github.\nThe Future Someday, this blog may undergo its next conversion using Rust, unless another cooler language comes along first.\nAlso, once work on Alpaca is complete, we will have a widget with my Hotel Recommendation assistant, or some nice tables and graphs with Hotel Review data, or both.\nThanks for reading!

highly recommend it.</del></p><h4 id=alternatives-hahahugoshortcode4s13hbhb>Alternatives <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f914.png?v8 alt=:thinking: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#alternatives-hahahugoshortcode4s13hbhb>#</a></h4><p>Other options I considered for deployment over the years were Google App Engine, <a href=https://www.render.com>Render</a> and a VM on Digital
Ocean or a <a href=https://docs.oracle.com/es-ww/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier_topic-Always_Free_Resources.htm>free Oracle VM</a>.</p><p>After running off a Google Bucket with local-only Pelican html generation, I settled on Netlify a few years back because
it works very nicely, can scale to a full-blown app with CDN and content management, and
more importantly <a href=https://ericarellano.tech/posts/netlify/>Netlify had Python 3.10</a> compatible images at the time.</p><p><del>This is a static HTML with some Javascript and a Pelican template. So, there is only one contributor, no
merging, PRs, and other differences with a production distributed microservice or hybrid service
architecture. Netlify has a nice build image for Python and static sites.</del></p><p>The above is no longer true (again). This is now a Hugo static microblog, which is published via Github Actions to Github Pages.</p><p>The conversion from Python (Pelican) to Go (Hugo) was done with the help of Grok to provide some handy Python scripts. Github Pages
is now very mature and Github Actions allows me to build the suite upon pushes to Main, then deploy off a special branch all without leaving Github.</p><h4 id=the-future-hahahugoshortcode4s15hbhb>The Future <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f52e.png?v8 alt=:crystal_ball: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-future-hahahugoshortcode4s15hbhb>#</a></h4><p>Someday, this blog may undergo its next conversion using Rust, unless another cooler language comes along first.</p><p>Also, once work on <a href=https://github.com/chukiagosoftware/alpaca>Alpaca</a> is complete, we will have a widget with my Hotel Recommendation assistant, or some nice tables
and graphs with Hotel Review data, or both.</p><h5 id=thanks-for-reading-hahahugoshortcode4s16hbhb>Thanks for reading! <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4b5.png?v8 alt=:dollar: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#thanks-for-reading-hahahugoshortcode4s16hbhb>#</a></h5><h4 id=some-links-hahahugoshortcode4s17hbhb>Some Links <img src=https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f517.png?v8 alt=:link: class=emoji style=display:inline-block;height:1em;width:1em;vertical-align:middle><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#some-links-hahahugoshortcode4s17hbhb>#</a></h4><p>Here are some useful links:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/CL02KD2ZFW8A>My Data Engineering Professional Cert</a></li><li><a href=https://www.credly.com/badges/91dbaf61-46b0-4d9c-9703-0ed47259000a/public_url>My Cisco Gen AI Blue Belt</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/edamsoft-sre>My Github</a></li><li><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-arellano-martinez>My LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href=https://x.com/>News</a></li><li><a href=https://www.k8s.io>Kubernetes</a></li><li><a href=https://goloang.org>Go</a></li><li><a href=https://registry.terraform.io>Terraform</a></li><li><a href=https://www.python.org>Python</a></li></ul><hr></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=https://ericarellano.tech/>Eric's Software Engineering Blog</a></span> ·
