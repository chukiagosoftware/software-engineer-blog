Another software engineering blog 



Officially a Computer and Electrical Engineer, B.Sc. (nice!). I&rsquo;ve also been a Network and Security, then Devops,
Site Reliability and more recently an AI, AWS and Go engineer. This is my blog, not a portfolio. Just some notes and
my most recent CI/CD and programming language which is Github Actions and Go. I&rsquo;ve also used Jenkins, ArgoCD, Cloudbuild,
Python, Javascript but, I&rsquo;m not going to talk about those.
My speciality du jour is building, deploying apps written in Go and Python and handling AWS, Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry or Prometheus metrics
for an end to end system such as for Generative AI (Large Language Models) applications.
While I am solely responsible for all this crap- I mean, content- I do have to thank Grok and Claude for helping make the
conversion fast and mostly painless. Also, thanks to my friends and family for supporting me and my wife."><meta name=author content="Eric Arellano"><link rel=canonical href=https://blog.ericarellano.tech/about/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.da3211e5ef867bf2b75fd5a6515cfed7195c011e8ab735694e203810a827097b.css integrity="sha256-2jIR5e+Ge/K3X9WmUVz+1xlcAR6KtzVpTiA4EKgnCXs=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://blog.ericarellano.tech/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://blog.ericarellano.tech/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://blog.ericarellano.tech/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://blog.ericarellano.tech/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://blog.ericarellano.tech/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://blog.ericarellano.tech/about/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51);color-scheme:dark}.list{background:var(--theme)}.toc{background:var(--entry)}}@media(prefers-color-scheme:light){.list::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--code-bg)}}</style></noscript><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light":window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches?document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="dark":document.querySelector("html").dataset.theme="light"</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.ericarellano.tech/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Go, Python, AI, Devops, AWS, GCP, Cloud Architecture"><meta property="og:title" content="About"><meta property="og:description" content=" Another software engineering blog Officially a Computer and Electrical Engineer, B.Sc.
